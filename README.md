## Comparing time complexities of different data structures for basic user functionality

### User Class (for ArrayList only)
User objects for storing users & passwords

### User/Pass Data
Usernames & passwords are randomly generated via a custom random class that takes in a range of integers (extended from Java random class)

### Time complexity comparison
Methods will track the time it takes to complete the following operations (each executed individually):
- Add
- Search
- Remove
User/Pass values for ArrayLists are stored in user objects; HashMap stores as a normal key/value pair
